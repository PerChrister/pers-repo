How does the application work?
The application works as an RPG simulation wherein the users may choose from 3 different Hero classes,
equip items such as weapons and gear equipment, simulate gaining XP and leveling up, and simulating an 
attacking scenario. 

I've managed to accomplish some of the requirements but didn't manage to apply the attacking scenario and
adding of the hero's base stats with the items' base stats.

The application starts with a short description and lore that lets the user accomplish a quest.
